      Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. The unexpected is our normal routine. They were just sucked into space. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! What? We're not at all alike! The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Computer, belay that order. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. We have a saboteur aboard. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I am your worst nightmare! I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Sorry, Data. Well, that's certainly good to know. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp.
